# C-GameEngine

This GameEngine is based on a tutorial series and is a great introduction for beginners to OpenGL since I teach the basic concepts.
Following aspects can be learned:
  - Modern OpenGL
  - Object Oriented Programming concepts for OpenGL
  - Basic GameEngine features (e.g., Phyiscs, Shading and Component-Based Entity Systems)

## Features:

  - Opening a Window and setting its Clear-Color

# Dependencies

 - SDL2
 - GLM
 - OpenGL
 - GLEW

# Development

Want to use this engine? Great!

The project files for VisualStudio (2015) are included in this repository. For a more detailled explaination see this [video][devVid].

You may want to use other IDEs or Compilers; Therefore, add the Dependencies (listed above) to the linker and have fun.

# Todos

 - Write automated tests
 - Add samples for each component of the engine
 - Add shader support
 - Add texture support
 - Add lighting (Deferred shading)
 - Add component based entity system
 - Add scene support
 - Add static models
 - Add animated models
